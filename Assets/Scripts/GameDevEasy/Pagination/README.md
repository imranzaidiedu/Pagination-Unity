# Pagination-Unity
Hi! This project is to provide a generic pagination system for Unity projects. It is a simple system which uses a dictionery and a linked list to keep track of the pages and you can preload some pages before-hand and set the max cache size as well to limit memory usage.

## Current Functionalities:
- Get current page
- Get next page
- Get previous page

## Todo:
- Jump to page by page number
- Implement circular pagination means when the last page is presented the next page will be page 1 or 0
